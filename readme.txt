== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this Require a Bullhorn Account? =

You must have an active Bullhorn Account to use Matador.

= Why Does This Require PHP 7.1? =

Matador Jobs Pro Extensions built for Matador Jobs 3.7.0 and later require a more modern version of PHP, the programming language we build Matador Jobs and its extensions on. This is to ensure we have access to the tools to produce powerful, robust, and maintainable code. While our core product supports an older PHP version, we ask users of our All Access Extensions to keep more up-to-date with modern PHP.

As it is, at the time of us writing this document, PHP 7.1 was more than a year past the end of support lifetime. Keep up to date with modern PHP to ensure your website is safe from security issues present in older versions of PHP.

= Where can I get support? =
